# Super-Bowl-Exploratory-Analysis
In this notebook, I have performed Exploratory Analysis of Super Bowl dataset by loading, cleaning, then exploring Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. I have visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. Also, there was line plots usage to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases.
